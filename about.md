![Eric Hayes](/assets/about.jpg)

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Jacobian Engineering](https://jacobianengineering.com/).  I'd like to consider myself a generalist, but I tend to gravitate towards the following areas:

- Backend development
- Software Architecture
- Computer Security
- Automation

## What do I think about Things & Stuff?
What's an about page without philosophies right?  Here are mine:

- Don't half-ass things.
- Hard work + passion = innovation.
- It's important to ask "why" as much as possible, even if you annoy people.
- Embrace the unexpected. Have direction in life, but don't be inflexible to change.

## What interests me non-professionally?
I love the outdoors and believe that there's no such thing as being outside too much. You can usually find me:

- Running, especially trail half marathons. You can find me on [athlinks](http://www.athlinks.com/athletes/ejhayes) or [strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/3394621).
- Backpacking/Hiking: My favorites so far are the ["Lost Coast"](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.395733227295378&type=1&l=ff29e7bbb7), Big Sur, [Yosemite](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.360927284109306.1073741837.100005761123225&type=1&l=a086106544), [Mammoth](https://www.instagram.com/p/9PUorkid7u/), and [Kirkwood](https://www.instagram.com/p/6_0484Cd5y/).
- Sailing: SF Bay area, [Sacramento Delta](https://www.instagram.com/p/5yKnDKCd0L/) (the "Caribbean" of the California), and 6 weeks at sea spread out between the [Greek Cyclades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclades), [Grenadines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenadines), and [BVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Virgin_Islands)).
- Road Biking: If you haven't done so, make sure to register for [RSVP](https://www.instagram.com/p/6dq4Spidzy/) or [STP](https://www.instagram.com/p/qaCP5UCdxt/). Beautiful countryside and friendly people!
- Dog Sledding: 10 days, 150 miles of sledding through the [Alaskan Wilderness](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=360940214108013&l=270936b375). And yes, the Northern Lights are spectacular. Thanks [Bush Alaska Expeditions](http://www.bushalaskaexpeditions.com/)!
- Rock Climbing: In the warmer part of the year you can find me at [Castle Rock](https://climbing.ilooove.it/page/eric-hayes-81259?image=79453&template=user&idpage=81259) or [Bishop](https://climbing.ilooove.it/page/eric-hayes-81259?image=79450&template=user&idpage=81259).
