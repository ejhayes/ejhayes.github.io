![Eric Hayes](/assets/about.jpg)

I'm Eric Hayes, but you probably already knew that.  I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Jacobian Engineering](https://jacobianengineering.com/).  I'd like to consider myself a generalist, but I tend to gravitate towards the following professional areas:

- Backend development
- Software Architecture
- Computer Security
- Automation

## My Philosophies

- You can’t hire someone to think for you, no matter how much you pay. Innovation comes from hard work and genuine interest.  If you’re gonna half-ass something, don’t start.
- When you simplify you get to understand and interact with the “essence” of a problem. Solving lots of problems allows you to better understand the "bigger" picture.
- Embrace the unexpected.  The unexpected brings new opportunities and shines light on who we are and how we react to the unknown.  Have direction, but don’t be inflexible to change.

## What interests me non-professionally?
I love the outdoors and believe that there's no such thing as being outside too much. You can usually find me:

- Running, especially trail half marathons. You can find me on [athlinks](http://www.athlinks.com/athletes/ejhayes) or [strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/3394621).
- Backpacking/Hiking: My favorites so far are the ["Lost Coast"](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.395733227295378&type=1&l=ff29e7bbb7), Big Sur, [Yosemite](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.360927284109306.1073741837.100005761123225&type=1&l=a086106544), [Mammoth](https://www.instagram.com/p/9PUorkid7u/), and [Kirkwood](https://www.instagram.com/p/6_0484Cd5y/).
- Sailing: SF Bay area, [Sacramento Delta](https://www.instagram.com/p/5yKnDKCd0L/) (the "Caribbean" of the California), and 6 weeks at sea spread out between the [Greek Cyclades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclades), [Grenadines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenadines), and [BVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Virgin_Islands)).
- Road Biking: If you haven't done so, make sure to register for [RSVP](https://www.instagram.com/p/6dq4Spidzy/) or [STP](https://www.instagram.com/p/qaCP5UCdxt/). Beautiful countryside and friendly people!
- Dog Sledding: 10 days, 150 miles of sledding through the [Alaskan Wilderness](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=360940214108013&l=270936b375). And yes, the Northern Lights are spectacular. Thanks [Bush Alaska Expeditions](http://www.bushalaskaexpeditions.com/)!
