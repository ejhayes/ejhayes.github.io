title: Mock APIs with API Blueprint, Dredd, api-mocks, and rails
cdn: mock-apis
---

Here's a story we're all too familiar with: you're developing an API and webapp at the same time.  API first is [all the rage these days](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/emergence-api-first-development/2014/01/09).  At some point frontend developers will need to connect to a backend API.  They can mock out API behavior for a little while, but may wind up in trouble if the final API is very different than what was expected. You don't want to rush API development, but you need to share something with the people developing the frontend...sooner rather than later.

Now this may sound obvious, but the thing about coding is this: **you don't just start writing code**. Instead, you spend a good chunk of time figuring out what to build.  The better idea you have of what needs to be built, the faster you'll be able to build it once you get started.  You're also less likely to build features that aren't needed or introduce unnecessary code (*less is more!*).  Just like the frontend, the design phase is equally important for the API.

Rather than starting to code the API, wouldn't it be nice if you could:

- Design the API using a modeling language that is programming language agnostic.
- Provide frontend developers with a mocked API that matches the specification above, with no additional development effort.
- Implement the actual API such that it behaves according to the same specification as the mocked API.

Thankfully there are several such API modeling languages out there that make it relatively straightforward to accomplish the goals above.  The main competitors are:

- [Swagger](http://swagger.io/)
- [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/)
- [RAML](http://raml.org/)

Looking for some comparisons?  Check out the following articles:

- [http://www.mikestowe.com/2014/07/raml-vs-swagger-vs-api-blueprint.php](http://www.mikestowe.com/2014/07/raml-vs-swagger-vs-api-blueprint.php)
- [http://www.infoq.com/news/2015/02/api-alternatives](http://www.infoq.com/news/2015/02/api-alternatives)
- [http://nordicapis.com/top-specification-formats-for-rest-apis/](http://nordicapis.com/top-specification-formats-for-rest-apis/)

The general consensus seems to be that there's no clear winner in the API modeling language game.  PLUS--there's tools to convert between modeling languages, so migration is always a potential option should one of the modeling langauges become deprecated down the road.

For my project, I chose [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org) for the following reasons:

- Easy to understand (markdown is pretty easy to read)
- Easy to write (markdown)
- Tooling seems decent ([dredd](http://dredd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), [api-mock](https://github.com/localmed/api-mock), and [many more](https://apiblueprint.org/#tooling))

Ok, so how do I get started with all of this?

## Start by installing dependencies
Please note that I'm working on a Mac and using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) so my notes are for that kind of setup.

### node (using v0.10.40)
`dredd` and `api-mock` are node tools so you'll need node.

    brew install nodejs

### dredd (v1.0.1) / api-mock (v0.2.2)
Use `npm` to install `dredd` and `api-mock`:

    npm install -g dredd api-mock

### ruby2.2 / rails4.2
This is documented [here](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.10-yosemite).  If you're on Yosemite and experiencing any OpenSSL issues, take a look at this [article](https://bearmetal.eu/theden/install-ruby-2-dot-2-0-yosemite-openssl-error/).  Once ruby is installed you can install `rails` and `bundler` like this:

    gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc rails bundler

Great, now we can get started.

## Time to create the dummy API

We want our API to have a single endpoint located at `/dummy`.  It will respond to a `GET` request with the following plaintext: `hello world`.  If we're using curl, it would behave like this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl -v -X GET localhost:3000/dummy
*   Trying ::1...
* connect to ::1 port 3000 failed: Connection refused
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 3000 (#0)
> GET /message HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:3000
> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< X-Powered-By: Express
< Content-Type: text/plain
< Content-Length: 17
< Date: Mon, 23 Nov 2015 06:00:07 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
<
hello world
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
{% endhighlight %}

### API Blueprint

The associated specification (a.k.a "spec") file describing this API would look like this:

#### dummyapi.apib

    # My API
    ## GET /dummy
    + Response 200 (text/plain)

      hello world

### Mock API Server

To run this mock API, run this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ api-mock ./dummyapi.apib --port 3000                                           
info:    Enabled Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS)
info:     Allow-Origin: *
info:     Allow-Methods: GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS
info:     Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, Referer, Prefer
info:    Listening on port 3000
{% endhighlight %}

You now have a dummy mocked API (on `http://localhost:3000`).  Sweet!

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl -v -X GET localhost:3000/dummy
*   Trying ::1...
* connect to ::1 port 3000 failed: Connection refused
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 3000 (#0)
> GET /message HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:3000
> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< X-Powered-By: Express
< Content-Type: text/plain
< Content-Length: 17
< Date: Mon, 23 Nov 2015 06:00:07 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
<
hello world
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
{% endhighlight %}

## Implementation Time
All is fine and dandy, but what do you do when you want to start implementing this api in some language like ruby, python, go, etc?  That's where [dredd](https://dredd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) comes in.  The tagline for `dredd` is:

    > Dredd is a language agnostic command-line tool for testing API documentation written in the API Blueprint format against its backend implementation.

This means that:

- Your API documentation can always be up to date (use a CI system like [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/apiaryio/dredd-example/builds/51376601#L458) or Jenkins to accomplish this).
- You can verify that the API you build conforms to the same standards as the mocked api.

### Configure dredd

`dredd` has an interactive configuration mode so you can get started quickly.  For our example, run `dred init` to get started:

{% highlight bash %}
$ dredd init
? Location of the API blueprint: apiary.apib
? Command to start API backend server e.g. (bundle exec rails server) bundle exec rails s
? URL of tested API endpoint: http://localhost:3000
? Programming language of hooks: ruby
? Do you want to use Apiary test inspector? No
? Found CircleCI configuration, do you want to add Dredd to the build? No

Configuration saved to dredd.yml

Install hooks handler and run Dredd test with:

  $ gem install dredd_hooks
  $ dredd
{% endhighlight %}

This results in a `dredd.yml` file that looks like this:

{% highlight yaml %}
dry-run: null
hookfiles: ./hooks.rb
language: ruby
sandbox: false
server: bundle exec rails s
server-wait: 3
init: false
custom: {}
names: false
only: []
reporter: []
output: []
header: []
sorted: false
user: null
inline-errors: false
details: false
method: []
color: true
level: info
timestamp: false
silent: false
path: []
blueprint: apiary.apib
endpoint: 'http://localhost:3000'
{% endhighlight %}

**NOTE**: Ignore the `hookfiles` part right now.  We'll get to that soon.

### Implement the dummy API

Before creating the implementation, lets see what happens if we just try running this by itself:

{% highlight bash %}
$ dredd
Configuration dredd.yml found, ignoring other arguments.
Starting server with command: bundle exec rails s
Waiting 3 seconds for server command to start...
Could not locate Gemfile or .bundle/ directory
info: Beginning Dredd testing...
error: GET /dummt duration: 4ms
error: Error connecting to server under test!
info: Displaying failed tests...
fail: GET /dummy duration: 4ms
fail: Error connecting to server under test!
complete: 0 passing, 0 failing, 1 errors, 0 skipped, 1 total
complete: Tests took 9ms
{% endhighlight %}

Dredd attempted to start up our api...and it didn't exist.  Can't test something that doesn't exist!  I'll quickly setup a quick rails app.

{% highlight bash %}
$  rails new dummyapi
      create
      create  README.rdoc
      ...
Bundle complete! 12 Gemfile dependencies, 53 gems now installed.
{% endhighlight %}

And run `dredd` again:

{% highlight bash %}
$ dredd
Configuration dredd.yml found, ignoring other arguments.
Starting server with command: bundle exec rails s
Waiting 3 seconds for server command to start...

complete: Tests took 451ms
{% endhighlight %}

We now see 1 failing test (`/dummy`), with the following errors:

- `fail: headers: Header 'content-type' has value 'text/html; charset=utf-8' instead of 'text/plain; charset=utf-8'`
- `body: Real and expected data does not match.`
- `statusCode: Status code is not '200'`

I haven't set any endpoints up yet, so these errors are letting me know what's missing.

#### routes.rb

{% highlight ruby %}
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'dummy', to: 'api#dummy'
  ...
end
{% endhighlight %}

#### app/controllers/api_controller.rb

{% highlight ruby %}
class ApiController < ApplicationController

  def dummy
    render plain: "hello world"
  end

end
{% endhighlight %}

Now to test again...

    $ dredd
    Configuration dredd.yml found, ignoring other arguments.
    Starting server with command: bundle exec rails s
    Waiting 3 seconds for server command to start...

What's going on here?  Well, it turns out there there's some extra whitespace in a `text/plain` response.  This is documented [here](https://dredd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hooks-ruby/#remove-trailing-newline-character-for-in-expected-plain-text-bodies).  This is where the hook system comes into play.

### Dredd hooks

Dredd hooks are documented [here](https://dredd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hooks/).  Common use cases for hooks include (taken from the dredd documentation):

- loading db fixtures
- cleanup after test step or steps
- handling authentication and sessions
- passing data between transactions (saving state from responses to stash)
- modifying request generated from blueprint
- changing generated expectations
- setting custom expectations
- debugging via logging stuff

In our case we can use the hooks to clean up the newline character in the expected result.  For ruby/rails, this means that we'll need to install the `dredd_hooks` gem: 

    gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc dredd_hooks

Then we'll create a `hooks.rb` file that looks like the following:

#### hooks.rb

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'dredd_hooks'
include DreddHooks::Methods

before_each do |transaction|
  if transaction['expected']['headers']['Content-Type'].match(/^text\/plain/)
    transaction['expected']['body'] = transaction['expected']['body'].gsub(/^\s+|\s+$/, "")
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}


Now to run dredd again (**important**: `hookfiles` must be set in `dredd.yml` to `./hooks.rb`):

{% highlight bash %}
$ dredd
Configuration dredd.yml found, ignoring other arguments.
Starting server with command: bundle exec rails s
Waiting 3 seconds for server command to start...
[2015-11-22 23:17:31] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1

This will result in much slower performance, but it will still work.
You should re-install spawn-sync or upgrade to the lastest version of node if possible.

pass: GET /message duration: NaNms
complete: 1 passing, 0 failing, 0 errors, 0 skipped, 1 total
complete: Tests took 2245ms
{% endhighlight %}

Success!  You have now accomplished the following:

- Created an API spec using API Blueprint.
- Created a Mock API for the API Spec (this can be used by anyone working on the frontend--and yes, they can work offline with the mock api).
- Used dredd to test the implemented API against the specification. We used ruby, but language really doesn't matter here!
